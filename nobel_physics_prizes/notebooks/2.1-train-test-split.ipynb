    "The [notable physicists dataframe](../data/interim/notable_physicists.csv) consists of a list of great physicists from the Ancient Greeks to modern times. I would like to reduce this to a list of modern physicists who have lived in the years when the *Nobel Prize in Physics* has been awarded. To be more precise, the Nobel Prize in Physics was first awarded on *10 December 1901* on the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. The prize has been awarded on the anniversary of his death every year since, excluding the few years in which no prize was awarded. Essentially, I would like a list of physicists who were alive on and after this date. Many of these physicists have died and many of them are still alive.\n",

Naturally, some of these are Nobel Laureates and some are not. The aim is to use the training set to build models that predict whether a physicist who is still alive has been awarded or is likely to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. So it is natural that my *test set* only consists of physicists who are still alive."
