That is, they were alive on and after 10 December 1901, the date the prize was first awarded. All of the physicists in the list are deceased. The data was purposely sampled in this way as the aim is to use the training set to build models that predict whether a physicist who is still alive has been awarded or is likely to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n",
