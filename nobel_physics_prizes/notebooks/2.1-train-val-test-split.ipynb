    "The [physicists dataframe](../data/interim/physicists.csv) consists of a list of great physicists from the Ancient Greeks to modern times. We would like to reduce this to a list of modern physicists who were eligible to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. To be more precise, the Nobel Prize in Physics was first awarded on **10 December 1901** on the anniversary of *Alfred Nobel's* death. The prize has been awarded on the anniversary of his death every year since, excluding the few years in which no prize was awarded. Essentially, we would like a list of physicists who were alive on and after this date. Some of these physicists are deceased and some are alive.\n",

We choose to use a validation set for model selection instead of cross-validation as the later is not appropriate due to this \"pseudo-time component\" of the data."
