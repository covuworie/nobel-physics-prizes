Moving on to Stanford University Guth formally proposed the idea of cosmic inflation in 1981, the idea that the nascent universe passed through a phase of exponential expansion that was driven by a positive vacuum energy density (negative vacuum pressure).

Huxley is of renown in the field of condensed matter physics. While at the CEA laboratory in Grenoble, Huxley was involved in the revolutionary discovery of superconductivity in the ferromagnet UGe2 under applied pressure, in collaboration with a team at Cambridge University [2]. This was followed up by a series of breakthroughs in another ferromagnetic material, URhGe [3-5], which was found to turn superconducting under the application of an external magnetic field. This emergence of an unconventional superconducting state by the application of an external tuning parameter such as magnetic field or pressure is hypothesised to be closely related to a 'Quantum critical point' (QCP) - a special phase transition that occurs at temperatures approaching zero kelvins. Quantum fluctuations are enhanced at the QCP, destabilising the conventional phase that dominates under ambient conditions, making conditions propitious for the emergence of a novel unconventional phase such as superconductivity, or possibly even more exotic states. Huxley earned a BA from Churchill College, Cambridge University, an MS from the University of Pennsylvania, and a PhD from Cambridge University.

"Ann Elizabeth Nelson (born 1958) is a particle physicist at the University of Washington. She was a student of Howard Georgi and has been a member of the university's Particle Theory Group since 1994. She and her collaborators are known for a number of theories, including the theory of spontaneous violation of CP (charge conjugation and parity symmetry), which may explain the origin of the asymmetry observed between matter and anti-matter; the theory of Bose-Einstein condensation of kaon mesons in dense matter, which predicts strangeness in neutron stars; the basic mechanism for electroweak baryogenesis which may explain the origin of matter in the universe; the theory of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking to account for how supersymmetry at short distances might be compatible with the absence of observed flavor symmetry violation at long distances; the Little Higgs theory which may explain why the Higgs boson must be relatively light; and the theory of ""accelerons"" which relates neutrino masses to the cosmological dark energy responsible for the relatively recent acceleration of the expansion of the universe.

"Brian Harold May, CBE (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist, best known as the lead guitarist of the rock band Queen. He uses a home-built electric guitar, called the Red Special. His compositions for the band include ""We Will Rock You"", ""Tie Your Mother Down"", ""I Want It All"", ""Fat Bottomed Girls"", ""Flash"", ""Hammer to Fall"", ""Save Me"", ""Who Wants to Live Forever"" and ""The Show Must Go On"". May was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer Freddie Mercury and drummer Roger Taylor, having previously performed with Taylor in the band Smile, which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player John Deacon completing the lineup, Queen had become established as one of the biggest rock bands in Britain with the album A Night at the Opera and its single ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at Live Aid in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work. Following the death of Mercury in 1991, Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists. In 2005, a Planet Rock poll saw May voted the 7th greatest guitarist of all time. He was ranked at No. 26 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"". In 2012, May was ranked the 2nd greatest guitarist of all time by a Guitar World magazine readers poll. He was appointed a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2005 for ""services to the music industry and for charity work"".

Hill has made contributions to dynamical theories of electroweak symmetry breaking, and is an originator of the top quark infrared fixed point, top quark condensates, topcolor, top-seesaw models, and dimensional deconstruction. He is also an originator of cosmological models of dark energy and dark matter based upon ultra-low mass (Nambu-Goldstone) bosons generally associated with neutrino masses. With David Schramm (astrophysicist), he developed transport equations describing the evolution of the spectrum of ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays and proposed modern theories of the origin of ultra-high-energy (UHE) nucleons and (UHE) neutrinos from grand unification relics, such as cosmic strings and monopole annihilation. In the 1980s he developed functional Schrödinger field theory methods for treating problems in quantum cosmology and carried out detailed calculations of local operator matrix elements at Feynman-loop level in Rindler space.

Lindley is known for writing entertaining scientific texts that show not only great knowledge of physics, but also a wit and understanding of what the layman can grasp. Most of his books explain the scientific theories through the use of a scientist's biography or an historical account of disagreement amongst scientists. In The End of Physics, Lindley challenged the assumption that string theorists might achieve a unified theory. He contended that particle physics was in danger of becoming a branch of aesthetics, since these theories could be validated only by subjective criteria, such as elegance and beauty, rather than through experimentation.",,,,1956-01-01,,,1956 births|Academic journal editors|British physicists|British science writers|Living people|Theoretical physicists,,,"David Lindley (born 1956) is a theoretical physicist and author.

Currently, he works at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Amsterdam. At a symposium at the Dutch Spinoza-institute on 8 December 2009 he introduced a theory of entropic gravity. In this theory, gravity exists because of a difference in concentration of information in the empty space between two masses and its surroundings; he also extrapolates this to general relativity and quantum mechanics. He said in an interview with the newspaper de Volkskrant, ""On the smallest level Newton's laws don't apply, but they do for apples and planets. You can compare this to pressure of gas. Molecules themselves don't have any pressure, but a barrel of gas has.""

"Gerd Binnig (born 20 July 1947) is a German physicist, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 for the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope. He was born in Frankfurt am Main and played in the ruins of the city during his childhood. His family lived partly in Frankfurt and partly in Offenbach am Main, and he attended school in both cities. At the age of 10, he decided to become a physicist, but he soon wondered whether he had made the right choice. He concentrated more on music, playing in a band. He also started playing the violin at 15 and played in his school orchestra. Binnig studied physics at the J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt, gaining a bachelor's degree in 1973 and remaining there do a PhD with in Werner Martienssen's group, supervised by Eckhardt Hoenig. In 1969, he married Lore Wagler, a psychologist, and they have a daughter born in Switzerland and a son born in California. His hobbies are reading, swimming and golf. In 1978, he accepted an offer from IBM to join their Zürich research group, where he worked with Heinrich Rohrer, Christoph Gerber and Edmund Weibel. There they developed the scanning tunneling microscope (STM), an instrument for imaging surfaces at the atomic level.The Nobel committee described the effect that the invention of the STM had on science, saying that ""entirely new fields are opening up for the study of the structure of matter."" The physical principles on which the STM was based were already known before the IBM team developed the STM, but Binnig and his colleagues were the first to solve the significant experimental challenges involved in putting it into effect. The IBM Zürich team were soon recognized with a number of prizes: the German Physics Prize, the Otto Klung Prize, the Hewlett Packard Prize and the King Faisal Prize. In 1986, Binnig and Rohrer shared half of the Nobel Prize in Physics, the other half of the Prize was awarded to Ernst Ruska. In 1985, Binnig invented the atomic force microscope (AFM)  and Binnig, Christoph Gerber and Calvin Quate went on to develop a working version of this new microscope for insulating surfaces. In 1987 Binnig was appointed IBM Fellow. In the same year, he started the IBM Physics group Munich, working on creativity and atomic force microscopy In 1994 Professor Gerd Binnig founded Definiens which turned in the year 2000 into a commercial enterprise. The company developed Cognition Network Technology to analyze images just like the human eye and brain are capable of doing. in 2016, Binnig won the Kavli Prize in Nanoscience.

"Goran Senjanović (born June 9, 1950) is a theoretical physicist at the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP). He received his Ph.D. at the City College of New York in 1978, under the supervision of Rabindra Mohapatra. Before joining the ICTP in 1991, he worked as a staff member at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and as a professor of physics at the University of Zagreb. His major research interests are neutrino physics, unification of elementary particle forces, baryon and lepton number violation and supersymmetry. Senjanović is best known for the seesaw mechanism, which he proposed together with Rabindra Mohapatra in 1979, independently of Peter Minkowski, Sheldon Lee Glashow, Murray Gell-Mann, Pierre Ramond, Richard Slansky and Tsutomu Yanagida. The seesaw mechanism is today the main scenario behind the mystery of tiny neutrino mass. According to this mechanism, the origin of neutrino mass is attributed to the existence of its heavyright-handed neutrino. In the works of Minkowski, and Mohapatra and Senjanovic, the smallness of neutrino mass is related to the maximality of parity violation in weak interactions. Senjanović, together with Mohapatra, Jogesh Pati and Abdus Salam, is one of the proponents of the left-right symmetric theory of electroweak interactions, introduced in order to understand the origin of parity violation in nature. In this theory, the left-right symmetry is broken spontaneously, which allows for its restoration at high energies. In this context, in a paper with Wai-Yee Keung in 1983, he proposed a way to directly probe lepton number violation and test the Majorana nature of right-handed neutrinos at hadron colliders, today a paradigm for such processes at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Senjanović is also known for his work on supersymmetric gauge coupling unification. Following the original suggestions of Savas Dimopoulos, Stuart Raby and Frank Wilczek, and Luis Ibáñez and Graham G. Ross, together with William J. Marciano, he showed in 1981 that the supersymmetric unification was tied to the large top quark mass, around 200 GeV, years before experiment.

"Igor Romanovich Klebanov (Russian: И́горь Романович Клеба́нов; 29 March 1962) is a theoretical physicist whose research is centered on relations between string theory and quantum gauge field theory. Since 1989, he has been a Professor at Princeton University where he is currently a Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics.In 2016 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Born in the Soviet Union in 1962, he emigrated to the U.S. as a teenager. He received his undergraduate education at MIT (class of 1982), and his Ph.D. degree at Princeton University as a student of Curtis Callan in 1986.In his thesis he made advances in the Skyrme model of hadrons.Klebanov worked as a post-doc at SLAC.His main contributions to string theory are in Matrix model approaches to two-dimensional strings, in brane dynamics, and more recently in the gauge theory-gravity duality.His work in 1996-97 on relations between branes in supergravity and their gauge theory description anticipated the gauge theory-gravity correspondence. Klebanov's 1998 paper Gauge Theory Correlators from Non-Critical String Theory with his graduate student Gubser, and Polyakov, which made a precise statement of the AdS/CFT duality, is among the all-time top cited papers in high-energy physics (it has over 7800 citations according to Google Scholar).A series of papers by Klebanov and collaborators on D-branes on the conifold has led to discovery of cascading gauge theory. Its dual warped throat provides a geometric description of color confinement and chiral symmetry breaking; it has been used in model building for cosmology and particle physics. The relation between 3-dimensional critical O(N) model and bosonic higher-spin gauge theory in 4-dimensional AdS space has been called the Klebanov-Polyakov correspondence.",,Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Princeton University,,1962-03-29,,Russia|Soviet Union,"American physicists|Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|Guggenheim Fellows|Living people|Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni|Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences|Princeton University alumni, 1980–89|Princeton University faculty|Soviet emigrants to the United States|String theorists|Theoretical physicists",,,"Igor Romanovich Klebanov (Russian: И́горь Романович Клеба́нов; 29 March 1962) is a theoretical physicist whose research is centered on relations between string theory and quantum gauge field theory.

"Jagadeesh Subbaiah Moodera is an American physicist of Indian origin and is senior research scientist at MIT's Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory. In 1994 he led an MIT research team in the discovery of a practical way to implement room temperature magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) using a magnetic stack based on CoFe–Al2O3–Co, demonstrating a tunnel magnetoresistance ratio (TMR) of 11.8%. Low temperature magnetoresistive tunneling had been discovered by Michel Julliere in 1975 but it would be more than a decade before a room temp system was found. In 1991, Terunobu Miyazaki and others at Tohoku University had demonstrated a MTJ with room temp TMR of 2.7% but this effect was too small to be of use in practical devices. In 1994, Miyazaki's team, working independently of Moodera's, also developed a room temperature MTJ with high TMR (18.0%) based on an Fe–Al2O3–Fe stack, thus garnering recognition as co-developer of room temp magnetoresistive tunnelling along with Moodera. Besides its great fundamental interest, room temperature magnetoresistive tunnelling is the basis for practical devices including MRAM and read heads used in hard disks. Moodera was named a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2000 ""for pioneering and sustained contributions to the understanding of spin-polarized transport in solids."" Before investigating ferromagnetic tunneling, Moodera worked for many years on spin-polarized tunneling in superconductor junctions along with Bob Meservey and Paul Tedrow. Moodera, Meservey, Tedrow and Miyazaki shared the 2009 Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize ""for pioneering work in the field of spin-dependent tunneling and for the application of these phenomena to the field of magnetoelectronics.""

He has produced extensive research in elementary particles, field theory, high energy phenomenology and dissipative systems. Young has contributed greatly to the development of higher education in Hong Kong, administering grants, educational program development, and worked to develop both Chinese and international professional associations by assuming various responsibilities during their development. In the later stages of his career Young has moved away from administration roles in universities, and toward direct teaching of students. He reflects that ""one has to have passion in one’s subject. You cannot disguise it and it would help tremendously if the students could feel and see you have it in you. It makes teaching all the more effective.""

Born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, did her high school at Colégio Marechal Rondon in Canoas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, undergraduate and graduate studies at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Brazil. After getting her PhD she spent two years as a postdoc at the research group of Michael Fisher at the University of Maryland. Back in Brazil she got a permanent position at the UFRGS where she is working until today., as Full Professor of Physics. She is a researcher with publications, thesis advised and organization of schools and international conferences. A molecule of water – two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen – seems simple enough, but the properties of this mysterious substance have baffled scientists for generations. Throughout her career, Barbosa has sought to unlock the secrets of water’s anomalies, initially from a theoretical perspective and then by focusing her insights on practical applications for medicine and the life sciences. Barbosa's work has helped explain why many characteristics of water – the motion of its molecules, its reaction to changes in temperature and pressure – make it different from other liquids in vast and important ways, and how biomolecules such as DNA, proteins and fats interact with water within the human body. She has furthermore developed a series of models about the properties of water that have contributed to our understanding of water’s interactions with biological molecules and geological processes. In 1998 she became involved with the gender issue in physics. She worked as chair of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics Working Group on Women in Physics. This group organized a number of conferences on women in physics. In 2008 she became vice-president of the Union of Pure and Applied Physics and director of the Instituto de Física da UFRGS.

"Mark Brian Wise (born November 9, 1953, Montreal) is a Canadian-American theoretical physicist. He has conducted research in elementary particle physics and cosmology. He is best known for his role in the development of heavy quark effective theory (HQET), a mathematical formalism that has allowed physicists to make predictions about otherwise intractable problems in the theory of the strong nuclear interactions. He has also published work on mathematical models for finance and risk assessment. Wise was born in Montreal, Canada. He was educated at the University of Toronto (B.S., 1976; M.S., 1977) and Stanford University (Ph.D., 1980). While still a student, he co-authored a book on mathematical methods in physics with Toronto professor Lynn Trainor. With Fred Gilman, his graduate advisor at Stanford, Wise wrote several highly influential papers on experimental predictions of the quark model. Wise was a junior fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows from 1980 to 1983. He has been at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) since then. Wise is currently the John A. McCone Professor of High Energy Physics at Caltech, a fellow of the American Physical Society, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the National Academy of Sciences. From 1984 to 1987 he was a fellow of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. He shared the 2001 Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics with Nathan Isgur and Mikhail Voloshin, ""for the construction of the heavy quark mass expansion and the discovery of the heavy quark symmetry in quantum chromodynamics, which led to a quantitative theory of the decays of c and b flavored hadrons.""

He is currently the Principal Investigator of the Transient Dendritic Solidification Experiment (TDSE) , a flight experiment being prepared for operations on the International Space Station in 2006. In June 2003, Koss created a controversy by authoring an Op Ed article in the New York Times claiming that scientists bore partial responsibility for the space shuttle Columbia disaster. He argued that most micro-gravity scientific experiments did not require manned space missions, but were used to sell the space program.

"Nicola A. Spaldin is a professor of materials theory at ETH Zurich, known for her pioneering research on multiferroics. She is the 2015 winner of the Körber European Science Prize for ""laying the theoretical foundation for the new family of multiferroic materials"". Spaldin earned a bachelor's degree in natural sciences from the University of Cambridge in 1991, and a Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley in 1996. Shewas inspired to search for multiferroics, magnetic ferroelectric materials, by a remark about potential collaboration made by a colleague studying magnetic phenomena during her postdoctorate studying ferroelectrics at Yale University in 1996–1997. She continued to study the theory of these materials as a new faculty member at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and in 2000 published ""a seminal article"" that for the first time explained why few such materials were known. In 2003 she was part of a team that experimentally demonstrated the multiferroic properties of bismuth ferrite. She moved from UCSB to ETH Zurich in 2010.

He is also Adjunct Professor at Birla Institute of Technology & Science (BITS), Pilani, Rajasthan, India. He also teaches graduate level courses at these institutes. He has been made a visiting professor for the year 2015-2016 at the Indian Council of Philosophical Research (ICPR), a Government of India body, under the Ministry of Human Resource Development. In January 1990, he organized a conference titled First International Conference on the Study of Consciousness within Science in San Francisco. Subsequently, in 1997 Gomatam conceived and launched the world's first M.S./Ph.D. programs in ""consciousness studies"", in collaboration with the Birla Institute of Technology & Science (BITS), Pilani (one of India's foremost technological universities). ""Consciousness Studies"" is a developing, inter-disciplinary scientific field, which Gomatam has particularly reconceived as a new way of studying matter. In 2015, the Institute of Semantic Information Sciences and Technology started offering M.A. (by research) and Ph.D. programs  in collaboration with the Mumbai University, India.

"Tom Banks (born April 19, 1949 in New York City) is a theoretical physicist at University of California, Santa Cruz and a professor at Rutgers University. His work centers around string theory and its applications to high energy particle physics and cosmology. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1973. He was several times a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (1976-78, 1983-84, and in the fall of 2010). Along with Willy Fischler, Stephen Shenker, and Leonard Susskind, he is one of the four originators of M(atrix) theory, or BFSS Matrix Theory, an attempt to formulate M theory in a nonperturbative manner. Banks proposed a conjecture known as Asymptotic Darkness - it posits that the physics above the Planck scale is dominated by black hole production. He has often criticized the widely held assumption in the string theory community that background spacetimes with different asymptotics can represent different vacua states of the same theory of quantum gravity. Rather, Banks argues that different asymptotics correspond to different models of quantum gravity. Many of his arguments for this and other ideas are contained in his paper ""A Critique of Pure String Theory: Heterodox Opinions of Diverse Dimensions."" published in 2003.",,,,1949-04-19,,New York City,"1949 births|American physicists|Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars|Living people|Rutgers University faculty|String theorists|University of California, Santa Cruz faculty",,,"Tom Banks (born April 19, 1949 in New York City) is a theoretical physicist at University of California, Santa Cruz and a professor at Rutgers University.

"Viatcheslav Fyodorovich Mukhanov (Russian: Вячесла́в Фёдорович Муха́нов; born October 2, 1956) is a Soviet/Russian theoretical physicist and cosmologist. He is best known for the theory of Quantum Origin of the Universe Structure. Working in 1980-1981 with Gennady Chibisov in the Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow he predicted the spectrum of inhomogeneities in the Universe, which are originated from the initial quantum fluctuations.

"Xiao-Gang Wen (simplified Chinese: 文小刚; traditional Chinese: 文小剛; pinyin: Wen2 Xiao3 Gang1) (born November 26, 1961) is a Chinese-born American physicist. He is a Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His expertise is in condensed matter theory in strongly correlated electronic systems. He is the author of a book in advanced quantum many-body theory entitled, Quantum Field Theory of Many-body Systems: From the Origin of Sound to an Origin of Light and Electrons (Oxford University Press, 2004). Wen studied superstring theory under theoretical physicist Edward Witten at Princeton University where he received his Ph.D. degree in 1987. He later switched his research field to condensed matter physics while working with theoretical physicists Robert Schrieffer, Frank Wilczek, Anthony Zee in Institute for Theoretical Physics, UC Santa Barbara(1987–1989). Wen introduced the notion of topological order (1989) and quantum order (2002), to describe a new class of matter states. This opens up a new research direction in condensed matter physics. He found that states with topological order contain non-trivial boundary excitations and developed chiral Luttinger theory for the boundary states (1990). The boundary states can become ideal conduction channel which may lead to device application of topological phases. He proposed the simplest topological order — Z2 topological order (1990), which turns out to be the topological order in the toric code. He also proposed a special class of topological order: non-Abelian quantum Hall states. They contain emergent particles with non-Abelian statistics which generalizes the well known Bose and Fermi statistics. Non-Abelian particles may allow us to perform fault tolerant quantum computations. With Michael Levin, he found that string-net condensations can give rise to a large class of topological orders (2005). In particular, string-net condensation provides a unified origin of photons, electrons, and other elementary particles (2003). It unifies two fundamental phenomena: gauge interactions and Fermi statistics. He pointed out that topological order is nothing but the pattern of long range entanglements. This led to a notion of symmetry protected topological (SPT) order (short-range entangled states with symmetry) and its description by group cohomology of the symmetry group (2011). The notion of SPT order generalizes the notion of topological insulator to interacting cases. He also proposed the SU(2) gauge theory of high temperature superconductors (1996).",,Princeton University|University of Science and Technology of China,,1961-11-26,,Beijing|China,"1961 births|American physicists|Chinese emigrants to the United States|Living people|Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty|Princeton University alumni, 1980–89|Theoretical physicists|University of Science and Technology of China alumni",,,"Xiao-Gang Wen (simplified Chinese: 文小刚; traditional Chinese: 文小剛; pinyin: Wen2 Xiao3 Gang1) (born November 26, 1961) is a Chinese-born American physicist.
