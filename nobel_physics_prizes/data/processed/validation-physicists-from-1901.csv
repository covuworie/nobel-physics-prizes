"Abdul Qadeer Khan, NI, HI, FPAS /ˌɑːbˈdʊl kɑːdɪər kɑːn/ (Urdu: ڈاکٹر عبد القدیر خان‎; b. 1 April 1936), known as A. Q. Khan, is a Pakistani nuclear physicist and a metallurgical engineer, who founded the uranium enrichment program for Pakistan's atomic bomb project. Khan founded and established the Kahuta Research Laboratories (KRL) in 1976, serving as both its senior scientist and Director-General until he retired in 2001. Khan was also a figure in other Pakistani national science projects, making research contributions to molecular morphology, the physics of martensite alloys, condensed matter physics, and materials physics. In January 2004, the Pakistani government summoned Khan for a debriefing on his active role in nuclear weapons technology proliferation in other countries after the United States provided evidence of it to the Pakistanis. Khan formally admitted his responsibility for these activities a month later. The Pakistani government dismisses allegations that Pakistani authorities sanctioned Khan's activities. After years of official house arrest during and following his debriefing, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on 6 February 2009 declared Abdul Qadeer Khan to be a free citizen of Pakistan, allowing him free movement inside the country. The verdict was rendered by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Aslam. In September 2009, concerned because the decision also ended all security restrictions on Khan, the United States warned that Khan still remained a ""serious proliferation risk"".",,Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Delft University of Technology|Technical University of Berlin,Hilal-i-Imtiaz|Nishan-e-Imtiaz,1936-04-27,,Bhopal|India|Princely state,1936 births|Catholic University of Leuven alumni|D.

In 2002, he and undergraduate student Louis Poirier transmitted faster-than-light electrical pulses through a 120-metre long ""photonic crystal"" made of coaxial cables of alternating characteristic impedance (12 pairs of 50 Ω and 75 Ω cables). The experiment showed that the pulse envelope was recreated at the end of the cables at a speed of >3 c.

As a junior particle physicist, Guth developed the idea of cosmic inflation in 1979 at Cornell and gave his first seminar on the subject in January 1980. Moving on to Stanford University Guth formally proposed the idea of cosmic inflation in 1981, the idea that the nascent universe passed through a phase of exponential expansion that was driven by a positive vacuum energy density (negative vacuum pressure). The results of the WMAP mission in 2006 made the case for cosmic inflation very compelling.",,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Dirac Medal|Franklin Medal|Fundamental Physics Prize|Gruber Prize in Cosmology|Isaac Newton Medal|Kavli Prize|MIT School of Science Prize|Oscar Klein Medal,1947-02-27,,"New Brunswick|New Brunswick, New Jersey","1947 births|American astronomers|American physicists|Cosmologists|Jewish American scientists|Living people|Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty|Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences|People from New Brunswick, New Jersey|Theoretical physicists",,,"Alan Harvey Guth (born February 27, 1947) is an American theoretical physicist and cosmologist.

Huxley is of renown in the field of condensed matter physics. While at the CEA laboratory in Grenoble, Huxley was involved in the revolutionary discovery of superconductivity in the ferromagnet UGe2 under applied pressure, in collaboration with a team at Cambridge University [2]. This was followed up by a series of breakthroughs in another ferromagnetic material, URhGe [3-5], which was found to turn superconducting under the application of an external magnetic field. This emergence of an unconventional superconducting state by the application of an external tuning parameter such as magnetic field or pressure is hypothesised to be closely related to a 'Quantum critical point' (QCP) - a special phase transition that occurs at temperatures approaching zero kelvins. Quantum fluctuations are enhanced at the QCP, destabilising the conventional phase that dominates under ambient conditions, making conditions propitious for the emergence of a novel unconventional phase such as superconductivity, or possibly even more exotic states. Huxley earned a BA from Churchill College, Cambridge University, an MS from the University of Pennsylvania, and a PhD from Cambridge University.

He has been a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge since 1962, and served as professor of physics from 1974 until 2007. In the early 1970s Josephson took up transcendental meditation and turned his attention to issues outside the boundaries of mainstream science. He set up the Mind–Matter Unification Project at the Cavendish to explore the idea of intelligence in nature, the relationship between quantum mechanics and consciousness, and the synthesis of science and Eastern mysticism, broadly known as quantum mysticism. Those interests have led him to express support for topics such as parapsychology, water memory and cold fusion, and have made him a focus of criticism from fellow scientists.",,University of Cambridge,Elliott Cresson Medal|Faraday Medal|Fellow of the Royal Society|Nobel Prize in Physics,1940-01-04,Brian David Josephson,Cardiff,"1940 births|Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge|British Jews|British Nobel laureates|Cold fusion|English Nobel laureates|Fellows of the Institute of Physics|Fellows of the Royal Society|Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge|Jewish physicists|Living people|Nobel laureates in Physics|Parapsychologists|People from Cardiff|Quantum mind|Transcendental Meditation practitioners|Welsh Jews|Welsh Nobel laureates|Welsh physicists",one daughter,,"Brian David Josephson, FRS (born 4 January 1940), is a Welsh theoretical physicist and professor emeritus of physics at the University of Cambridge.

"Brian Harold May, CBE (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist, best known as the lead guitarist of the rock band Queen. He uses a home-built electric guitar, called the Red Special. His compositions for the band include ""We Will Rock You"", ""Tie Your Mother Down"", ""I Want It All"", ""Fat Bottomed Girls"", ""Flash"", ""Hammer to Fall"", ""Save Me"", ""Who Wants to Live Forever"" and ""The Show Must Go On"". May was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer Freddie Mercury and drummer Roger Taylor, having previously performed with Taylor in the band Smile, which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player John Deacon completing the lineup, Queen had become established as one of the biggest rock bands in Britain with the album A Night at the Opera and its single ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at Live Aid in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work. Following the death of Mercury in 1991, Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists. In 2005, a Planet Rock poll saw May voted the 7th greatest guitarist of all time. He was ranked at No. 26 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"". In 2012, May was ranked the 2nd greatest guitarist of all time by a Guitar World magazine readers poll. He was appointed a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2005 for ""services to the music industry and for charity work"". May attained a PhD in astrophysics from Imperial College London in 2007 and was Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University from 2008 to 2013. He was a ""science team collaborator"" with NASA's New Horizons Pluto mission. He is also a co-founder of the awareness campaign, Asteroid Day. Asteroid 52665 Brianmay was named after him.

"Carl Richard Hagen (/ˈheɪɡən/; born 2 February 1937) is a professor of particle physics at the University of Rochester. He is most noted for his contributions to the Standard Model and Symmetry breaking as well as the 1964 co-discovery of the Higgs mechanism and Higgs boson with Gerald Guralnik and Tom Kibble (GHK). As part of Physical Review Letters 50th anniversary celebration, the journal recognized this discovery as one of the milestone papers in PRL history. While widely considered to have authorerd the most complete of the early papers on the Higgs theory, GHK were controversially not included in the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 2010, Hagen was awarded The American Physical Society's J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics for the ""elucidation of the properties of spontaneous symmetry breaking in four-dimensional relativistic gauge theory and of the mechanism for the consistent generation of vector boson masses"". Professor Hagen's research interests are in the field of theoretical high-energy physics, primarily in the area of quantum field theory. This includes the formulation and quantization of higher spin field theories within the context of Galilean relativity as well as that of Special relativity. Work in recent years has been concerned with such topics as the soluble two dimensional theories, Chern–Simons field theory, the Aharonov–Bohm effect, and the Casimir effect. In 2015, Hagen authored a paper that found the classic 17th century Wallis formula for π while calculating energy levels of the Hydrogen atom - the first paper to derive π from physics and quantum mechanics. Born and raised in Chicago, Hagen received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At MIT, his doctoral thesis topic was in quantum electrodynamics. He has been a professor of physics at the University of Rochester since 1963. Professor Hagen won the Award for Excellence in Teaching, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Rochester twice (in 1996 and 1999).

"Clemens C.J. Roothaan (born in August 29, 1918 in Nijmegen) is a Dutch physicist. He enrolled TU Delft in 1935 to study electrical engineering. During World War II he was first detained as a prisoner of war camp. Later he and his brother were sent to the Vught concentration camp for involvement with the Dutch Resistance. On September 5, 1944, the remaining prisoners of the camp (including the Roothaan brothers) were moved to the Sachsenhausen camp in Germany ahead of the advancing Allies. Near the end of the war, the Sachsenhausen inmates were sent on a death march which Roothaan's brother did not survive. While a prisoner of war he was able to pursue his studies in physics together with other professors and students under the formal guidance of Philips. The work he was assigned to while cooperating with Philips was a foundation for his master's thesis. He obtained his master's degree in physics from TU Delft on October 14, 1945. After that he moved to USA, where he did his PhD thesis with Robert S. Mulliken from the University of Chicago, on semiempirical MO theory, while holding a post at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.. He realised that the then current approach to molecular orbital theory was incorrect and changed his topic to what resulted in the development of the Roothaan equations. Prof. Mulliken mentions this work in his Nobel lecture as follows: I tried to induce Roothaan to do his Ph.D. thesis on Hückel-type calculations on substituted benzenes. But after carrying out some very good calculations on these he revolted against the Hückel method, threw his excellent calculations out the window, and for his thesis developed entirely independently his now well known all-electron LCAO SCF self-consistent-field method for the calculation of atomic and molecular wave functions, now appropriately referred to, I believe, as the Hartree–Fock-Roothaan method. He had moved to the University of Chicago in 1949 and his PhD was awarded in 1950. He then joined the Physics Department of the University of Chicago. From 1962 to 1968 he was Director of the University of Chicago Computation Centre. Later he was Professor of Physics and Chemistry at the University of Chicago. Since his retirement, in 1988, he has worked for the Hewlett-Packard Laboratories in Palo Alto, California, where his primary contribution has been in the development of the mathematical coprocessor routines for the Itanium chip. His method of analyzing pipeline architecture has been unique and innovative and greatly admired in supercomputer circles around the world.

Getzler studied from 1979 to 1982 at the Australian National University in Canberra (bachelor's degree with honours in 1982) and then at Harvard University, where he received his PhD in 1986 under Arthur Jaffe with thesis Degree theory for Wiener maps and supersymmetric quantum mechanics. From 1986 to 1989 he was a Junior Fellow at Harvard. In 1989 he became an assistant professor and in 1993 an associate professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1997 he became an associate professor and in 1999 a professor at Northwestern University, where he now works. He was a guest professor at several universities, including the Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik in Bonn (1996), l'École Normale Supérieure (1992), l'Institut Henri Poincaré (2007), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, the Imperial College London (2007/8), and the University of Paris VI. In 2002 and in 2003/4 he was at the Institute for Advanced Study.

He was born in Frankfurt am Main and played in the ruins of the city during his childhood. His family lived partly in Frankfurt and partly in Offenbach am Main, and he attended school in both cities. At the age of 10, he decided to become a physicist, but he soon wondered whether he had made the right choice. He concentrated more on music, playing in a band. He also started playing the violin at 15 and played in his school orchestra. Binnig studied physics at the J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt, gaining a bachelor's degree in 1973 and remaining there do a PhD with in Werner Martienssen's group, supervised by Eckhardt Hoenig. In 1969, he married Lore Wagler, a psychologist, and they have a daughter born in Switzerland and a son born in California. His hobbies are reading, swimming and golf. In 1978, he accepted an offer from IBM to join their Zürich research group, where he worked with Heinrich Rohrer, Christoph Gerber and Edmund Weibel. There they developed the scanning tunneling microscope (STM), an instrument for imaging surfaces at the atomic level.The Nobel committee described the effect that the invention of the STM had on science, saying that ""entirely new fields are opening up for the study of the structure of matter."" The physical principles on which the STM was based were already known before the IBM team developed the STM, but Binnig and his colleagues were the first to solve the significant experimental challenges involved in putting it into effect. The IBM Zürich team were soon recognized with a number of prizes: the German Physics Prize, the Otto Klung Prize, the Hewlett Packard Prize and the King Faisal Prize. In 1986, Binnig and Rohrer shared half of the Nobel Prize in Physics, the other half of the Prize was awarded to Ernst Ruska. In 1985, Binnig invented the atomic force microscope (AFM)  and Binnig, Christoph Gerber and Calvin Quate went on to develop a working version of this new microscope for insulating surfaces. In 1987 Binnig was appointed IBM Fellow. In the same year, he started the IBM Physics group Munich, working on creativity and atomic force microscopy In 1994 Professor Gerd Binnig founded Definiens which turned in the year 2000 into a commercial enterprise. The company developed Cognition Network Technology to analyze images just like the human eye and brain are capable of doing. in 2016, Binnig won the Kavli Prize in Nanoscience.

"Goran Senjanović (born June 9, 1950) is a theoretical physicist at the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP). He received his Ph.D. at the City College of New York in 1978, under the supervision of Rabindra Mohapatra. Before joining the ICTP in 1991, he worked as a staff member at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and as a professor of physics at the University of Zagreb. His major research interests are neutrino physics, unification of elementary particle forces, baryon and lepton number violation and supersymmetry. Senjanović is best known for the seesaw mechanism, which he proposed together with Rabindra Mohapatra in 1979, independently of Peter Minkowski, Sheldon Lee Glashow, Murray Gell-Mann, Pierre Ramond, Richard Slansky and Tsutomu Yanagida. The seesaw mechanism is today the main scenario behind the mystery of tiny neutrino mass. According to this mechanism, the origin of neutrino mass is attributed to the existence of its heavyright-handed neutrino. In the works of Minkowski, and Mohapatra and Senjanovic, the smallness of neutrino mass is related to the maximality of parity violation in weak interactions. Senjanović, together with Mohapatra, Jogesh Pati and Abdus Salam, is one of the proponents of the left-right symmetric theory of electroweak interactions, introduced in order to understand the origin of parity violation in nature. In this theory, the left-right symmetry is broken spontaneously, which allows for its restoration at high energies. In this context, in a paper with Wai-Yee Keung in 1983, he proposed a way to directly probe lepton number violation and test the Majorana nature of right-handed neutrinos at hadron colliders, today a paradigm for such processes at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Senjanović is also known for his work on supersymmetric gauge coupling unification. Following the original suggestions of Savas Dimopoulos, Stuart Raby and Frank Wilczek, and Luis Ibáñez and Graham G. Ross, together with William J.

Young has contributed greatly to the development of higher education in Hong Kong, administering grants, educational program development, and worked to develop both Chinese and international professional associations by assuming various responsibilities during their development. In the later stages of his career Young has moved away from administration roles in universities, and toward direct teaching of students. He reflects that ""one has to have passion in one’s subject.

"Márcia Cristina Bernardes Barbosa is a Brazilian physicist. Born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, did her high school at Colégio Marechal Rondon in Canoas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, undergraduate and graduate studies at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Brazil. After getting her PhD she spent two years as a postdoc at the research group of Michael Fisher at the University of Maryland. Back in Brazil she got a permanent position at the UFRGS where she is working until today., as Full Professor of Physics. She is a researcher with publications, thesis advised and organization of schools and international conferences. A molecule of water – two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen – seems simple enough, but the properties of this mysterious substance have baffled scientists for generations. Throughout her career, Barbosa has sought to unlock the secrets of water’s anomalies, initially from a theoretical perspective and then by focusing her insights on practical applications for medicine and the life sciences. Barbosa's work has helped explain why many characteristics of water – the motion of its molecules, its reaction to changes in temperature and pressure – make it different from other liquids in vast and important ways, and how biomolecules such as DNA, proteins and fats interact with water within the human body. She has furthermore developed a series of models about the properties of water that have contributed to our understanding of water’s interactions with biological molecules and geological processes. In 1998 she became involved with the gender issue in physics. She worked as chair of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics Working Group on Women in Physics. This group organized a number of conferences on women in physics. In 2008 she became vice-president of the Union of Pure and Applied Physics and director of the Instituto de Física da UFRGS. For her activities on gender issues she was awarded with the 2009 Nicholson Medal given by the American Physical Society.

"Nicola A. Spaldin is a professor of materials theory at ETH Zurich, known for her pioneering research on multiferroics. She is the 2015 winner of the Körber European Science Prize for ""laying the theoretical foundation for the new family of multiferroic materials"". Spaldin earned a bachelor's degree in natural sciences from the University of Cambridge in 1991, and a Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley in 1996. Shewas inspired to search for multiferroics, magnetic ferroelectric materials, by a remark about potential collaboration made by a colleague studying magnetic phenomena during her postdoctorate studying ferroelectrics at Yale University in 1996–1997. She continued to study the theory of these materials as a new faculty member at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and in 2000 published ""a seminal article"" that for the first time explained why few such materials were known. In 2003 she was part of a team that experimentally demonstrated the multiferroic properties of bismuth ferrite. She moved from UCSB to ETH Zurich in 2010. As well as winning the Körber Prize, Spaldin is a fellow of the American Physical Society (2008) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2013), and the 2010 winner of the American Physical Society's James C. McGroddy Prize for New Materials.

His research is in theoretical particle physics and focuses on theoretical mechanisms and observable implications of extra spacetime dimensions, supersymmetry, and strongly coupled dynamics. According to Scientific American.com, he was considering leaving Physics for Finance, when he called the now famous author and collaborator Lisa Randall to propose working together on membranes, or ""branes"" as they are known. Branes are domains or swaths of several spatial dimensions within a higher-dimensional space.

"Richard H. Price (born March 1, 1943) is an American physicist specializing in general relativity. Price graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1960, and went on to earn a dual degree in physics and engineering from Cornell University in 1965. He earned his Ph.D. in 1971 from Caltech under the supervision of Kip Thorne. He has spent most of his career at the University of Utah, but in 2004 joined Center for Gravitational Wave Astronomy at the University of Texas at Brownsville. Price is probably best known for a 1972 result now known as Price's theorem. This is usually informally stated as follows: any inhomogeneities in the spacetime geometry outside a black hole will be radiated away. (Any such inhomogeneities can be quantified as nonzero higher multipole moments.) Price's theorem explains how the no hair theorem is enforced. Price also made pioneering numerical simulations which established (nonrigorously) a precise scenario for the emission of gravitational radiation during the merger of two compact objects (such as two black holes). Subsequent work has largely confirmed the scenario which was first developed in his work. These simulations have provided a major impetus for the development of gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO. He has done much in development of pedagogical techniques in physics at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc levels; a significant portion at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, UT. He creates beautiful atlases of relativity. He continues to teach and do research as a professor emeritus at the University of Texas Brownsville.

He is now professor emeritus. He is a fellow of St. Michael's College, University of Toronto, the Origins Institute at McMaster University and Institute of Biocomplexity and Informatics at the University of Calgary. While active at the University of Toronto, in addition to math-based physics courses he taught an interdisciplinary course – The Poetry of Physics – which led to his collaboration with Marshall McLuhan, and his research in media ecology and the evolution of language. His best known works are The Alphabet Effect – based on a paper Logan co-authored with McLuhan – which develops the hypothesis that the alphabet, codified law, monotheism, abstract science and deductive logic form an autocatalytic set of ideas that developed uniquely between 2000 BC and 500 BC between the Tigris-Euphrates river system and the Aegean Sea; The Sixth Language: Learning a Living in the Internet Age which deals with the hypothesis that speech, writing, math, science, computing and the Internet form an evolutionary chain of languages; The Extended Mind: The Emergence of Language, the Human Mind and Culture develops a model for the origin of language, the human mind and culture using ideas from The Sixth Language. Logan has also been Chief Scientist at Strategic Innovation Lab at OCAD University in Toronto, Ontario since 2007, and a senior fellow at the university's Strategic Innovation Lab (sLab). Part of his work at OCAD involved a language-based project to change popular attitudes about the environment, which resulted in the coining of the word ""depletist"".

Jackiw is famous for the discovery of the so-called axial anomaly, also known as Adler–Bell–Jackiw anomaly, also known as the chiral anomaly. In 1969, Roman Jackiw and John Stewart Bell published their explanation, which was later expanded and clarified by Stephen L. Adler, of the (observed) decay of a neutral pion into two photons. This decay is forbidden by a symmetry of classical electrodynamics, but Bell and Jackiw showed that this symmetry cannot be preserved at the quantum level. Their introduction of an ""anomalous"" term from quantum field theory required that the sum of the charges of the elementary fermions had to be zero. This work also gave important support to the color-theory of quarks. Jackiw is also known for Jackiw–Teitelboim gravity also called the ""R—T model"".

Along with Willy Fischler, Stephen Shenker, and Leonard Susskind, he is one of the four originators of M(atrix) theory, or BFSS Matrix Theory, an attempt to formulate M theory in a nonperturbative manner. Banks proposed a conjecture known as Asymptotic Darkness - it posits that the physics above the Planck scale is dominated by black hole production. He has often criticized the widely held assumption in the string theory community that background spacetimes with different asymptotics can represent different vacua states of the same theory of quantum gravity. Rather, Banks argues that different asymptotics correspond to different models of quantum gravity. Many of his arguments for this and other ideas are contained in his paper ""A Critique of Pure String Theory: Heterodox Opinions of Diverse Dimensions."" published in 2003.",,,,1949-04-19,,New York City,"1949 births|American physicists|Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars|Living people|Rutgers University faculty|String theorists|University of California, Santa Cruz faculty",,,"Tom Banks (born April 19, 1949 in New York City) is a theoretical physicist at University of California, Santa Cruz and a professor at Rutgers University.

"V. Balakrishnan (born 1943 as Venkataraman Balakrishnan) is an Indian theoretical physicist who has worked in a number of fields of areas, including particle physics, many-body theory, the mechanical behavior of solids, dynamical systems, stochastic processes, and quantum dynamics. He is an accomplished researcher who has made important contributions to the theory of anelasticity, continuous-time random walks, and recurrences in dynamical systems. He received his PhD from Brandeis University in 1970. After a decade at TIFR and IGCAR Kalpakkam, he joined IIT Madras as a Professor of Physics in 1980. He was elected a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences in 1985. In addition to his research, Balakrishnan is a popular and noted teacher of physics, known for his engaging teaching style, which combines physical insight, mathematical rigor, and wry wit. He has taught a wide range of courses over the past 30 years from introductory physics to quantum field theory to dynamical systems. Two of his courses (38 lectures in Classical Physics and 31 in Quantum Physics) taught at IIT Madras through National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) are available on NPTEL's channel on YouTube, and are extremely popular, having received about 2.3 million views in all (as of December 2015). A third series appeared in June 2014 titled Selected Topics in Mathematical Physics. Towards the end of July 2014, NPTEL released a fourth series of lectures titled Topics in Nonlinear Dynamics. A fifth series of lectures appeared towards the end of November 2015 titled Physical Applications of Stochastic Processes. A sixth series entitled Non-equilibrium Statistical Mechanics was released in June 2016. Balakrishnan has authored the book Elements of Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics (CRC Press 2008). A review in the journal Soft Materials explained that rather than providing comprehensive coverage of the field of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, the book focuses on explaining the Langevin and Fokker–Planck equations. He co-authored the book Beyond the Crystalline State: An Emerging Perspective (Springer 1989). His wife, Radha Balakrishnan, is a theoretical physicist who works on nonlinear dynamics (in particular, solitons and integrable systems).

"Xiao-Gang Wen (simplified Chinese: 文小刚; traditional Chinese: 文小剛; pinyin: Wen2 Xiao3 Gang1) (born November 26, 1961) is a Chinese-born American physicist. He is a Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His expertise is in condensed matter theory in strongly correlated electronic systems. He is the author of a book in advanced quantum many-body theory entitled, Quantum Field Theory of Many-body Systems: From the Origin of Sound to an Origin of Light and Electrons (Oxford University Press, 2004). Wen studied superstring theory under theoretical physicist Edward Witten at Princeton University where he received his Ph.D. degree in 1987. He later switched his research field to condensed matter physics while working with theoretical physicists Robert Schrieffer, Frank Wilczek, Anthony Zee in Institute for Theoretical Physics, UC Santa Barbara(1987–1989). Wen introduced the notion of topological order (1989) and quantum order (2002), to describe a new class of matter states. This opens up a new research direction in condensed matter physics. He found that states with topological order contain non-trivial boundary excitations and developed chiral Luttinger theory for the boundary states (1990). The boundary states can become ideal conduction channel which may lead to device application of topological phases. He proposed the simplest topological order — Z2 topological order (1990), which turns out to be the topological order in the toric code. He also proposed a special class of topological order: non-Abelian quantum Hall states. They contain emergent particles with non-Abelian statistics which generalizes the well known Bose and Fermi statistics. Non-Abelian particles may allow us to perform fault tolerant quantum computations. With Michael Levin, he found that string-net condensations can give rise to a large class of topological orders (2005). In particular, string-net condensation provides a unified origin of photons, electrons, and other elementary particles (2003). It unifies two fundamental phenomena: gauge interactions and Fermi statistics. He pointed out that topological order is nothing but the pattern of long range entanglements. This led to a notion of symmetry protected topological (SPT) order (short-range entangled states with symmetry) and its description by group cohomology of the symmetry group (2011). The notion of SPT order generalizes the notion of topological insulator to interacting cases. He also proposed the SU(2) gauge theory of high temperature superconductors (1996).",,Princeton University|University of Science and Technology of China,,1961-11-26,,Beijing|China,"1961 births|American physicists|Chinese emigrants to the United States|Living people|Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty|Princeton University alumni, 1980–89|Theoretical physicists|University of Science and Technology of China alumni",,,"Xiao-Gang Wen (simplified Chinese: 文小刚; traditional Chinese: 文小剛; pinyin: Wen2 Xiao3 Gang1) (born November 26, 1961) is a Chinese-born American physicist.
