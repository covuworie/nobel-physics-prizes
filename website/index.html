                        <p>The <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/" target="_blank">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> is widely regarded as the most prestigious award in Physics. The prize is awarded by <a href="https://www.kva.se/en/startsida" target="_blank">The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> , Stockholm, Sweden. The will of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Nobel" target="_blank">Alfred Nobel</a> states that that the prize should be awarded to the "person [or persons] who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics".</p>
                        <p>The <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/physics/" target="_blank"></a> nomination and selection process is a lengthy and complex process taking just over a year. Three of the key stages are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>September - Nomination forms are sent out. <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/about/the-nobel-committee-for-physics/" target="_blank">The Nobel Committee for Physics</a> sends out confidential forms to around 3,000 people - selected professors at universities around the world, Nobel Laureates in Physics and Chemistry, and members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, among others.</li>
                            <li>March-May - Consultation with experts. The Nobel Committee for Physics</a> sends the names of the preliminary candidates to specially appointed experts for their assessment of the candidates' work.</li>
                            <li>October - Nobel Laureates are chosen. In early October, the Academy selects the Nobel Laureates in Physics through a majority vote. The decision is final and without appeal. The names of the Nobel Laureates are then announced.</li>
                        </ul></p>
                        <p>Most controversially, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/redirector/?redir=archive/list.php" target="_blank"></a> details of the nominations are not made public until 50 years after. The secretive nature of the selection process has led to claims of demographic bias in the selection process. Some of these claims have even been acknowledged by the Nobel Committee itself, especially concerned with how <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06879-z" target="_blank">few women have been awarded Nobel Prizes</a> in any science. They have even gone as far as <a href="https://qz.com/1097888/the-nobel-prize-committee-explains-why-women-win-so-few-prizes/" target="_blank">requesting more women are nominated</a> for awards in order to address this gender bias.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://physicstoday.scitation.org/journal/pto" target="_blank">Physics Today</a> has performed an extensive data examination of <a href="https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.4.20170925a/full/" target="_blank">physicists nominated for the Nobel Prize</a>. They see certain patterns in the data related to demographics of physicists such as:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Gender.</li>
                                <li>Age / years lived.</li>
                                <li>Nationality.</li>
                                <li>Institutions studied at and affiliated with.</li>
                                <li>Connected to past winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics or Chemistry through progreny or academics.</li>
                                <li>Theorist or experimentalist.</li>
                                <li>Astronomer of physicist.</li>
                            </ul>
                        If this bias were widespread it would certainly call into question the integrity and value of the prize.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Do demographics play a major role in selecting the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics?</li>

                        <h2>Methods</h2>
                        <p>In an attempt to answer these questions the following was done:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Collect demographic data on a list of almost a thousand world-renowned physicists from <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/about" target="_blank">DBPedia</a>.</li>
                            <li>Collect a list of Nobel Laureates in both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Physics&oldid=862097595" target="_blank">Physics</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Chemistry&oldid=860639110">Chemistry</a> from 1901-2017.</li>
                            <li>Build a machine learning model, based on demographic data alone, that predicts whether a physicist has won or will win the Nobel Prize.</li>
                        </ol></p>

                        <h2>Findings</h2>
                        <h3>Significant underlying patterns in the demographic data correlate to being a Physics Nobel Laureate</h3>
                        <p>The logistic regression model achieved a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthews_correlation_coefficient" target="_blank">Matthews Correlation Coefficient</a>  (MCC) of 0.36 when evaluated on the test data, which indicates that it performs much better than both random chance (MCC = 0) and a <em>naive</em> baseline classifier (MCC = 0.19). The conclusion is that there are significant underlying patterns in the demographic data that correlate with being a Physics Nobel Laureate. However, the number of false postives was too high to make any substantial claims about biases that may be present when deciding Nobel Physics Prize Winners.</p>
                        <h3>Top 7 demographic factors with the biggest influence on the classification</h3>
                        <p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Being an experimental physicist was by far the biggest factor resulting in a change in odds ratio of 5 times more than the next most influential factor.</li>
                                <li>Having at least one physics laureate doctoral student.
                                </li>
                                <li>Living for at least 65-79 years.</li>
                                <li>Being an alumnus in Asia.</li>
                                <li>Being a citizen of France.</li>
                                <li>Working at <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/" target="_blank">Bell Labs</a>.</li>
