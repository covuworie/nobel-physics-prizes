    "# Collect Physicists\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I need a list of physicists who are notable for their achievements. Wikipedia contains two such lists, one general [list of physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_physicists) and another list of [theoretical physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_theoretical_physicists). I will scrape these lists and unify them into a single list. It is important to recognize that some of these physicists have won the *Nobel Prize* and some have not and also that some are *dead* and some are *alive*. You should at least recognize a few of the more famous names in the list even if you do not recognize them all. The entire analysis of this project will be based on the data that is acquired on these physicists. OK time to get scraping."
